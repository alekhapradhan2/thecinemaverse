// app/robots.txt/route.ts
// ── What changed in this version ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//  1. /blog? now blocks ALL query string variations (was only ?q= before)
//  2. /movies?genre= blocked — duplicate of canonical /movies/genre/[genre]
//  3. /songs/category/ left crawlable (canonical), query dupes blocked
//  4. ★ PerplexityBot REMOVED from block list — Perplexity is an AI search
//     engine that cites sources and drives real referral traffic. Blocking it
//     prevents Ollypedia from appearing in Perplexity AI answers.
//  5. ★ Google-Extended REMOVED from block list — blocking this prevents
//     Ollypedia content from appearing in Google AI Overviews and Gemini
//     answers, which are a growing source of discovery traffic.
//  6. ★ FIX: /blog?category= explicitly allowed — sitemap.xml submits the 6
//     /blog?category=[X] pages (Box Office, Reviews, Actor, Songs, News, Top
//     Lists) as real keyword-targeted pages with priority up to 0.9, but the
//     blanket "Disallow: /blog?" rule was blocking Googlebot from crawling
//     them — submitted-but-blocked is a wasted/contradictory signal. Only
//     /blog?category= is allowed; all other /blog? query variants (e.g.
//     /blog?q=, /blog?page=) remain blocked as before.
//  ✅ All other existing rules preserved (pure training scrapers still blocked)
